## 🔑 Key Learnings

1. **Scalability**: Both EBS and EFS allow scaling, but EFS provides automatic scaling without intervention
2. **Availability**: EFS spans multiple AZs for higher availability compared to single-AZ EBS
3. **Cost Optimization**: Understanding trade-offs between EBS and EFS for different use cases
4. **Regional Architecture**: Best practices for multi-region deployments
5. **Security**: Proper security group configuration for accessing shared resources
